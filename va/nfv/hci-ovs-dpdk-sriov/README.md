# VA: OvS DPDK

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the OvS DPDK & SRIOV VA, then
please see the
[OvS DPDK & SRIOV README in the examples directory](../../../examples/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the OvS DPDK & SRIOV VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
